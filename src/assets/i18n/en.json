  "BLOOD":"Blood",
  "BLOOD SCRIPT":"Blood donation evolved significantly with Karl Landsteiner's discovery of blood types in 1901, the use of anticoagulants and storage methods during the World Wars, and the identification of the Rh factor in 1940. The mid-20th century saw the establishment of blood banks and donor programs, improving safety and accessibility.",
  "PLASMA":"Plasma",
  "PLASMA SCRIPT":"Plasma donation began gaining importance during World War II when it was used to treat wounded soldiers. The development of plasmapheresis in the 1960s allowed for the separation and collection of plasma, which led to more efficient and widespread plasma donation practices. Today, plasma is crucial for producing therapies for various medical conditions, including immune deficiencies and clotting disorders.",
